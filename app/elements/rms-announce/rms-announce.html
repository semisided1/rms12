          The redwatersoccer.ca website is launched!
          </p><p>
          A month ago I volunteered to create this site. It is sure to change but here are the basic ideas. The purpose of the site is to showcase our teams and provide a hub for information about our organization.
          </p><p>
          This website is built with modern browsers in mind which includes your cell phone. So because it does not display on older computers it must work on cell phones.
          </p><p>

          Managing email campaigns can be done using MailChimp. MailChimp will provide a way for users to subscribe and remove themselves from our emails. Multiple people can have management status to manage the lists and create emails. We can also make groups for the different teams / organizational committees.
          </p><p>

          On the U12 team page there are some Youtubes, which means we also have a youtube channel! I can also help you to learn how to create and upload videos.  
          </p><p>
          Some ideas to explore:
          <ul>
            <li>Shared calendars (outlook.com and google.com)</li>
            <li>Photo / Video / Results uploads (currently that will be done in the slack)</li>
            <li>More information on team pages - game sheets, roster, photos</li>
            <li>Soccer rules and coaching info</li>
            <li>Shoe trader</li>
            <li>Polices</li>
            <li>Organizational Profiles</li>
          </ul>

          </p>

          <p>A meeting was held Wednesday November 18th at Paradise Inn. Many issues where raised by parents and parent-coach liaisons. Redwater Minor Soccer would like to thank everyone who contributed either by email or in person and Paradise Inn for lending us the space. The meeting lasted 2 hours and it is clear that we are going through a period of change where more discussions will be forthcoming. Some of the topics discussed where:
